2: What are the limitations of props? 
( Bonus: Attempt to write an explanation as to how to address this limitation. There are plenty of explanations out there)

ans: props are set by parent and passed to child components and they are fixed throughout the component. we can not pass variables
back to child component to parent component.
Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component
