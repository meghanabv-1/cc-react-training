1: Write a brief about the differences between props and state? When do we use each? 


State:

states are mutable.
state changes can be asynchronous
states are associated with the individual components can't be used by other components.
states are initialize on component mount.
states are used for rendering dynamic changes within component.
State is limited to our current component 
We can pass the state of the current component as prop to other components.
state can be modified using this.setstate


props:

props are immutable.
props are read-only
you can pass props between components.
props are set by parent and passed to child components and they are fixed throughout the component
we have stateless components which only have props and not internal state.
if you want to change props you can do from parent component and then pass it to child components.
props cannot be modified


State and Props both hold information that influences the output of render, 
they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component. 
whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).
