1: What is the difference between composition and inheritance? Which paradigm is preferred in React?  Write a brief note about it in your own words.

Ans: Inheritance
In Inheritance one class inherits properties and methods of another class. 
This is useful in code reusability
it was difficult to add new behavior because the derived component was inheriting all the
properties of parent class and it was quite difficult to add new behavior.

Comosition
 Adding behavior is so simple in the composition that we just need to change the code in component only.
 We can add behaviors of our choice to any component without causing any trouble.

2: In what cases do we need to 'lift the state up'?

Ans:  every component in React has its own state. 
      Because of this sometimes data can be redundant and inconsistent. 
      So, by Lifting up the state we make the state of the parent component as a single source of truth 
      and pass the data of the parent in its children.

For Ex: If we have 2 components in our App. 
A -> B where, A is parent of B. keeping the same data in both Component A and B might cause inconsistency of data. 

3: What is a handler function. When do we use it?

Ans:
    Event handlers determine what action is to be taken whenever an event is fired. 
    This could be a button click or a change in a text input.
    
    Synthetic events
     It has the same interface as the browserâ€™s native event

The React onClick event handler enables us to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element,
such as a button, in our app.
